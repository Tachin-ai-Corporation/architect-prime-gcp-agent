// tool runner and work-output-read), and unhandled throws emit `Fatal: …`. The
// `/i` flag also covers the lowercase/`ERROR:` variants. Anchoring on `[ERROR]`
// alone silently missed `Error:`-prefixed auth failures.

 * Is a detected motor failure the task OUTCOME, or a sub-command error the motor RECOVERED
 * from? A multi-command motor task can have ONE command emit "command failed" in its tool log
 * and still finish — writing the full deliverable as its prose answer and self-verifying.
 * detectMotorFailure matches the failure pattern ANYWHERE in the combined output, so it flips
 * such a task to failed; the checkpoint then fails and the mission is reported `blocked` with
 * a complete answer inside it (observed live: a discovery that gathered all 18 service
 * accounts + instances blocked because one count command printed "command failed").
 *
 * The failure is the OUTCOME only when its marker is in the motor's ANSWER (the prose OUTSIDE
 * the [TOOL EXECUTION LOG]) or there is no substantive answer. A marker confined to the tool
 * log, with a real deliverable beside it, is a recovered incident — the caller should annotate
 * it and let checkpoint verification (cerebellum) arbitrate (B-28), not hard-fail the task.
 *
 * Conservative: returns true (recovered) ONLY when ALL hold — (1) the output has a tool-log
 * block, (2) a substantive answer sits outside it (>= minAnswerChars), (3) that answer does
 * NOT itself trip a failure pattern, and (4) the failure pattern IS inside the tool-log block.
 * Every other shape returns false, preserving the strict hard-fail.
 *
 * @param {*} output - the motor's full response (prose answer + tool log)
 * @param {{minAnswerChars?: number, requireActionRecovery?: boolean}} [opts]
 *   requireActionRecovery — for a DELIVERY-CRITICAL task (deploy/publish/promote), confident
 *   prose is NOT the deliverable, so the answer-length recovery path is disabled: recovery then
 *   requires PROOF the action itself succeeded on a retry (a non-failing tool call after the
 *   last failing one). Without this, a failed deploy with a long narrative soft-passes into a
 *   false-complete (observed live: a deploy hit HTTP 404 yet the mission reported ✅).
