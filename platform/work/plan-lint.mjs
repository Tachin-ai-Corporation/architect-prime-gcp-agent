// plan-lint.mjs — deterministic smells in a structured checkpoint plan
//
// The defect this exists to measure, from the comp-addendum mission:
//   CP1 Task 1  "Locate the master fixed comp addendum template within the … folder."
//   CP1 Task 2  "Duplicate the master template (identified in the previous task) three
//                times into the 'In Progress' folder (ID: FOLDER_ID). Name them …"
// Task 1 found the template and reported its id as a verified claim. Task 2 was a
// SEPARATE dispatch, so it had to re-resolve the phrase "identified in the previous
// task" from context — and picked the first row of a folder listing
// (…_Addendum_Retainer_Royalty) instead of …_Addendum_Retainer_Fixed.
// Three documents were built from the wrong template and every downstream
// find-replace then had nothing to match.
//
// The plan shape is the bug: a task whose required INPUT is an identifier a previous
// task must discover. Those two tasks are one outcome and must not be split. This
// module finds that shape so it can be counted rather than argued about.
//
// Deliberately conservative: a phrase must say "an input I need was produced by an
// earlier task". Ordinary sequencing ("after the drafts exist", "once the folder is
// ready", "for each advisor") carries no identifier dependency and is not a finding.
//
// Pure: no I/O, no clock, no randomness (B-19).

/**
 * Verbs that mean "an identifier was RESOLVED", and only those.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow. Weaker verbs (noted, listed, mentioned, specified, referenced,
 * reported, returned) were here and made "the responsibilities listed above" and "the
 * rates specified above" into findings — both of which point at the REQUEST, not at a
 * previous task's output. A lint that cries wolf gets ignored, which costs more than the
 * coverage it buys.
